% CODE CHALLENGE 4 - Linear Least-Squares Fit
%
% The purpose of this program is to calculate the equation of the best fit
% line for a data set using linear least-squares fitting.
%
% To complete the challenge, finish the code below to:
% 1) load data from csv file
% 2) find linear best fit coefficients and associated uncertainty
% 3) plot the original data along with the best fit line 
% 4) add errorbars for fit uncertainty to this plot from the data and from
%    the linear regression parameters
%
% NOTE: DO NOT change any variable names already present in the code.
% 
% Upload your team's script to Gradescope when complete.

%% Housekeeping (Please don't "clear all" or "clearvars", it makes grading difficult)
close all   % Close all open figure windows
clc           % Clear the command window

% %% Load and extract the time and velocity vectors from the data
% data = 
% t =     % [s]
% v =     % [m/s]
% 
% %% Calculations
% % Find number of data points in the vectors
% N = 
% 
% % Find linear best fit coefficients A and B
% % Create H matrix
% H = 
% 
% % Create y matrix
% y = 
% 
% % Create W matrix (hint: type <help diag> in command line)
% W = 
% 
% % Solve for P matrix
% P = 
% 
% % Solve for x_hat matrix and extract A and B parameters
% x_hat = 
% A = 
% B = 
% 
% % extract uncertainty in A and uncertainty in B from P matrix
% A_error = 
% B_error = 
% 
% %% Display acceleration with associated uncertainty and the intial velocity with associated uncertainty
% %  Make sure to use and display with CORRECT SIG FIGS
% 
% 
% %% Find predicted velocity values using your linear fit equation
% v_predicted = 
% 
% %% Ploting and Error Calculations
% % On the same plot, do the following:
% % 1. plot the velocity data vs time as a scatter plot 
% % 2. plot predicted velocity vs time as a line 
% % 3. title your plot so that it indicates what celestial body this data
% %    simulates
% % 4. Add measured velocity error bars and predicted velocity error bars to 
% %    the plot (hint - this will involve error propagation calculations
% v_err =
% v_predicted_error =
